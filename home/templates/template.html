                    <h2>About Manitoulin Metal</h2>
                    <p>Manitoulin Metal Robotics is a youth First Robotics Team located 6 hours north of Toronto, includes six First Nation Reserves, and is on the largest freshwater island in the world.  We know we can overcome any challenges through resilience, creative problem solving, teamwork, and mentorship.

                        Manitoulin Metal believes that all students, regardless of demographic and socio-economic status, should have equal opportunity/exposure to careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  Our Robotics Team aims to develop innovation, problem-solving, and creativity as we broaden our knowledge of robotics while developing a competitive Robotics team and providing team members with transferable skills useful in future career pathways. We are developing a Robotics Program in our school and building relationships with other Robotics teams, post-secondary programs, and industry. We apply these developing skills to become leaders of stewardship and environmental sustainability in our community and in the world.
                        
                        We were honoured and excited to win the FIRST Rookie Inspiration Award in 2018, the Judges' Award in 2020, and to finish in the Top 10 at our 2nd Event. In 2022, we were again honoured with the prestigious Judges Awards at the York Regional qualifier, the North Bay/Windsor Regional qualifier, our co-Captain Jocelyn Kuntsi is a provincial semi-finalist for the Dean's List award, and Safety Captain was recognized with the Safety All-Star Award!!
